# Moodle S3 Logs Plugin

This plugin allows Moodle to archive its logs to an S3 bucket.

Some reasons for doing so:

* The Moodle instance has been running for a long time and there is a requirement (regulatory or business) to keep logs around for a set period
* The logs have grown to such an extent that getting data from them becomes tedious

NOTE: This plugin should be considered deprecated, please use this plugin instead:
